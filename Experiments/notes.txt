How to recreate the experiments:

### PREREQUISITES ###
1. Install CoppeliaSim version 4.4.0 (https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads) and enable the ZeroMQ remote API according to the following instructions: https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/zmqRemoteApiOverview.htm
2. Install rustup (https://rustup.rs/)
3. Install the MPC controller from the following repository: https://github.com/Woodenonez/DyObAv_MPCnWTA_Warehouse
 a) Clone the repositroy and modify the requirements.txt file as follows:
  - change casidi version to 3.5.6rc2
  - torch and torchvision are optional and may be removed from the requirements.txt if you don't want to install them.
 b) Install requirements.txt with the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
 c) Follow the remaining installation instructions given in the repository.
4. Move the python scripts main_script_random_sampling.py and main_script_reinforcement_learning.py from our Experiments folder to the src folder of the controller repository.

### CONFIGURATION OF EXPERIMENTS ###
5. Edit the pyhton script main_script_random_sampling.py or main_script_reinforcement_learning.py (depending on which Experiments you want to run). See the paragraph in the code denoted by "PLEASE EDIT" and the corresponding comments for further explanation. Also, don't forget to set the PATH_TO_SCENEFOLDER to the location of the .ttt files (that is, to the "Simulation Models" folder from our repository.)
6. Execute the python script. If you have configured the remote API correctly (see step 1), this should automatically open CoppeliaSim and start the simulation.
7. The results will be saved in a file 'reports.csv' in your current working directory.
