*In the folder "Experiments" you can find the code and simulation models required to recreate our experiments.
*In the folder "Results", the results of our experiments are presented in the form of plots and diagrams (we do not provide an in-depth explanation of the diagrams, please refer to the paper for this).
*In the folder "Videos", you can find some exemplary videos from the simulation.
